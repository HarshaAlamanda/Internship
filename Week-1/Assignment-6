(1) Installing a Python Library
For this example, let's install the Matplotlib library, which is used for creating visualizations in Python.

1.Open a new Google Colab notebook.
2.Install Matplotlib by running the following code in a new code cell:
"!pip install matplotlib"
3.Execute the cell by pressing "Shift + Enter".

(2) Demonstrating the Usage of the Library
Once Matplotlib is installed, you can use it to create a simple plot. Add another code cell and write the following code to demonstrate its usage:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
# Generate some data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y, label='Sine Wave')
plt.title('Simple Plot with Matplotlib')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

(3) Collaborating on the Notebook
To collaborate with someone, follow these steps:
1.Click the "Share" button in the upper-right corner of the Colab notebook interface.
2.Enter the email address of the person you want to invite. Make sure you set the appropriate permissions
3.Click "Send" to invite them.

(4) Saving and Sharing Your Colab Notebook
To save your notebook to Google Drive and share it with others:
1.Save the notebook:
click on File -> Save a copy in Drive. This will save your notebook to your Google Drive.
2.Share the saved notebook:
-> Go to your Google Drive, locate the saved notebook.
->Right-click on the file and select Share.
->Enter the email addresses of the people you want to share the notebook with.
->Set their permissions (e.g., "Viewer" or "Commenter").
->Click "Send".
