Git & its purpose in version control, and why it is widely used in software development
Git is a version control system that you download onto your computer. It is essential that you use Git if you want to collaborate with other developers on a coding project or work on your own project.
It is widely used in software development because of its robustness, flexibility, and ability to handle large projects with complex histories. Additionally, its distributed nature allows for high redundancy and fault tolerance, making it a preferred choice for many development teams.
Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, manage different versions of the code, and collaborate efficiently.
Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently and later merge these branches back into the main codebase.
Multiple developers can work on different parts of a project concurrently, with Git managing conflicts and integrating changes seamlessly.
Distributed Nature: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, allowing offline work and reducing reliance on a central server.
Efficiency: Git handles large projects efficiently, with fast operations for committing, branching, and merging.
Robustness: It maintains a comprehensive history of changes, making it easier to track and manage project evolution.
Community and Integration: Git is supported by numerous platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and tools, making it an integral part of modern software development workflows.
Overall, Git's flexibility, efficiency, and support for collaboration make it a fundamental tool in contemporary software development.

Git vs Github
Git and GitHub are often discussed together, but they serve distinct purposes in the context of software development.
Git:
Git is a distributed version control system designed to manage and track changes in source code during development.
Git Type: Version Control System (VCS)
-> All operations (commits, branching, merging) are performed locally on a developerâ€™s machine.
-> Records changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions or compare changes over time.
-> Supports branching to develop features or fixes independently and merging branches to integrate changes.
-> Each user has a complete copy of the repository, which provides resilience and flexibility.
-> Primarily used to manage code versions and histories within a project.

Github:
GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional features to facilitate collaboration and project management.
Github Type: Hosting Platform for Git Repositories
